# Actions 

[[toc]]

## Motivation

Restify allow you to define extra actions for your repositories. Let's say you have a list of posts, and you have to publish them. Usually for this kind of operations, you have to define a custom route like: 


```php
// PostRepository

public static function routes(Router $router, $attributes, $wrap = true)
{
    $router->post('/publish', [static::class, 'publishMultiple']);
}

public function publishMultiple(RestifyRequest $request)
{
  ...
}
```

There is nothing bad with this approach, but when project growth, you will notice that the routes / repository can easily become a mess. 

More than that, you have to guess a route name or handler, should it be a controller, a callback or a method right in the repository class? Well, for this kind of operations, actions is what we need.

# Defining Actions

The action could be generated by using the command: 

```bash
artisan restify:action PublishPostsAction
```

This will generate for the handler class:

```php
namespace App\Restify\Actions;

use Binaryk\LaravelRestify\Actions\Action;
use Binaryk\LaravelRestify\Http\Requests\ActionRequest;
use Illuminate\Http\JsonResponse;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

class PublishPostAction extends Action
{
    public function handle(ActionRequest $request, Collection $models): JsonResponse
    {
        return $this->response()->respond();
    }
}
```

The `$models` represents a collection with all of the models for this query.


## Available actions

The frontend which consume your API could check available actions by using exposed endpoint: 

```http request
GET: api/restify-api/posts/actions
```

This will answer with a json like:

```json
[
"data": [
  {
    "name":  "Publish Posts Action",
    "destructive": false,
    "uriKey":  "publish-posts-action",
    "payload": []
  }
]
```

`name` - humanized name of the action

`destructive` - you may extend the `Binaryk\LaravelRestify\Actions\DestructiveAction` to indicate to the frontend than this action is destructive (could be used for deletions)

`uriKey` - is the key of the action, will be used to perform the action

`payload` - a key / value object indicating required payload

# Registering Actions

Once you have defined the action, you can register it for many resources. 


```php
public function actions(RestifyRequest $request)
{
    return [
        PublishPostAction::new(),
    ];
}
```

You can pass anything to the action constructor: 

```php
public function actions(RestifyRequest $request)
{
    return [
        PublishPostAction::new("Publish articles.", app(Validator::class)),
    ];
}
```

:::warning Repository model
You may consider that you have access to the `$this->resource` in the `actions` method (since it's not static).
However, in this method the `resource` is not available, since the request is for a new model.
:::

### Unauthorized

Actions could be authorized:

```php
public function actions(RestifyRequest $request)
{
    return [
        PublishPostAction::new()->canSee(function (Request $request) {
            return $request->user()->can('pubishAnyPost', Post::class),
        }),
    ];
}
```

### Authorizing Actions Per-Model

As you saw, we don't have access to the repository model in the `actions` method. However, we do have access to models in the handle method. You're free to use Laravel Policies there.


# Use actions

The usage of an action, means the `handle` method implementation. The first argument is the `RestifyRequest`, and the second one is a Collection of models, matching the `repositories` payload.


```http request
POST: api/restify-api/posts/actions?action=publish-posts-action
```

Payload:

```json
"repositories": [1, 2]
```

```php
public function handle(ActionRequest $request, Collection $models): JsonResponse
{
     // $models contains 2 posts (under ids 1 and 2)
    $models->each->publish();

    return $this->response()->respond();
}
```
