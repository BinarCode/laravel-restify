Laravel Restify is an extraordinary tool inspired by [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com/) for building a robust and modern API. If you already have an application built with Laravel Nova, you can transfer your data to Laravel Restify by using basically the same resource classes content.

If you don't have an application written with Nova, you can start with Laravel Restify from scratch and get a powerful API in a few minutes.
